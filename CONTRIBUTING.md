# Contributing to "Deliver value daily"

## Types of contributions

Contributions are welcome via the [GitHub PR mechanism](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork), subject to approval.

Particularly welcome are:

- Additions of techniques to help deliver value daily
- Changes that improve clarity, especially if they increase conciseness
- Technical changes that optimise https://delivervaluedaily.dev/
- Fixing of typos

In most cases before raising a PR it's best to start a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/delivervaluedaily/manifesto/issues), or discussion in either [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/delivervaluedaily/manifesto/discussions) or the ["Deliver value daily" Discord server](https://discord.gg/Y5SvjeFnAF).

## Technical contributions

The site at https://delivervaluedaily.dev/ is deliberately a single HTML page, with no external resources requested on load. There are no current plans to change this.

## Long-form content

The site at https://delivervaluedaily.dev/ is deliberately short. Links to long-form content hosted elsewhere may be added in future.

If you have suggestions for links to longer form content, feel free to raise a [GitHub discurssion](https://github.com/delivervaluedaily/manifesto/discussions) or [Discord discussion](https://discord.gg/Y5SvjeFnAF).
