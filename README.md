# "Achieve value daily"

A one-principle manifesto for agile software development

#### Why?

Following this one principle means...

You will need to maintain an understanding of what _value_ means for your organisation or team<br>
You will need to put things into place things to _achieve_ that value<br>
You will get _daily_ feedback validating your assumptions

And of course...

You will achieve value daily ðŸ˜‰

#### How?

The single most important technique is to choose something _smaller_ than what is assumed to be needed, and do whatever it takes to get that useable by some real users by the end of the day. Often it will be _much_ smaller, and ideally something that would even take much less than a day so you limit the risk of not completing it within the day, and you increase the chance of achieving value multiple times in the day.

To make this choice, you often need to be close to users - for example in direct contact with them. It also requires a certain level of confidence - do what it takes to develop this if you think you're low.

#### But... what about the 12 principles of [https://agilemanifesto.org/](https://agilemanifesto.org/)?

Following this one principle will result in adhering to many of the 12 principles - especially the ones that are important in your case.

#### But... what about anything that isn't _directly_ achieving value today?

You can do other tasks that don't directly result in value, but just not whole days at a time - at least _some_ time of each day should achieve value. By following the principle you will balance achieving value today with investing for more value tomorrow.

Do not refactor or address "tech debt" without a clear idea of how it leads to value. And of course, if something repeatedly doesn't lead to value, you should consider not doing it.

#### But... we work in two-week Sprints and I can't change that?

Do what you can to split out the smallest _valuable_ parts of remaining tasks, and get them as close as possible to releasable that you have the power to do every single day. Be the change you want to see.

#### But... I'm sure everything that's valuable will take more than a day

If you _really_ can't work out a smaller bit of work, look to the _why_ above - is there anything that can give you feedback, a better understanding of value, or set you up for acheiving value daily later on that you _can_ get done today?

It happens, but do whatever you can to make it so this is rare.
