# "Achieve value daily"

A one-principle Agile manifesto for software development

#### Why?

Following this one principle means...

You will need to maintain an understanding of what _value_ means for your organisation or team<br>
You will need to put things into place things to _achieve_ that value<br>
You will get _daily_ feedback validating your assumptions

And of course...

You will achieve value daily ðŸ˜‰

#### How?

The single most important technique is to choose something _smaller_ than what is assumed to be needed, and do whatever it takes to get that useable by some real users by the end of the day. Often it will be _much_ smaller, and ideally something that would even take much less than a day so you limit the risk of not completing it within the day.

See below for more specific techniques to keep in your mental toolbox (TODO).

#### But... what about the 12 principles of https://agilemanifesto.org/?

Following this one principle will result in adhering to lot of the 12 principles - at least, the ones that are important in your case.

#### But... what about refactoring/addressing tech debt/anything else that isn't _directly_ achieving value today?

You can! But just not whole days at a time. By following the principle you will balance achieving value today with investing for more value tomorrow.

#### But... we work in two-week Sprints and I can't change that?

Do what you can to split out the smallest _valuable_ parts of remaining tasks, and get them as close as possible to releasable that you have the power to do every single day.
