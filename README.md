# "Acheive value daily"

A one-principle Agile manifesto for software development

#### Why?

Following this one principle means...

You will need to get an understand of what _value_ means for your organisation or team<br>
You will need to put things into place things to _acheive_ that value<br>
You will get _daily_ feedback validating your assumptions

And of course...

You will acheive value daily ðŸ˜‰

#### How?

...

#### But... what about the 12 principles https://agilemanifesto.org/?

Following this one principle will result in adhering to lot of the 12 principles - at least, the ones that are important in your case.

#### But... what about refactoring/addressing tech debt/anything else that isn't _directly_ acheiving value today?

You can! But just not whole days at a time. By following the principle you will balance value today with investing for more value tomorrow.

#### But... we work in two-week Sprints and I can't change that?

Do what you can to split out the smallest useful parts of remaining tasks, and get them as close as possible to releasable every day.
